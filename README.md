This paragraph is your project description — a concise explanation of what the tool does.
It mentions three core technologies:

Streamlit – builds the web-based chatbot interface

FAISS – handles fast semantic search across the knowledge base

Google Gemini API – generates intelligent, human-like responses

The second line explains how it benefits users:

Helps Class X students learn Science interactively by retrieving syllabus-based, context-aware answers.

This is crucial because it connects the tech to the purpose — always keep that in your GitHub intro.

🚀 Features Section

Each bullet here highlights the key technical functionalities of your EduBot.

Feature	Description
🤖 Contextual Q&A	Uses Google Gemini API to generate natural, accurate answers based on student queries
📚 Semantic search	Uses FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) + Sentence Transformers to find relevant text chunks from stored science notes
💾 Query logging	Every student query is saved into a MySQL table (e.g., user_queries) with timestamps for analytics
🌐 Streamlit UI	Front-end chat interface allowing easy text input, chatbot responses, and context viewing
🧩 Modular architecture	Each function (embedding, retrieval, Gemini call, DB logging) is independent, so you can easily update or replace components
